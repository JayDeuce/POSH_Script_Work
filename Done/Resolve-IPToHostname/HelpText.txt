.SYNOPSIS
    Resolve IPs given to Hostnames.

.DESCRIPTION
    This will take the IPs passed and resolve them to their Hostnames, as well
    as check if they are pingable, and write that information to a CSV file in the C:\Temp
    directory by default. The report can also be a created in TXT format by passing the 
    the textReport switch (add -textReport to the end of the command)

.PARAMETER  ipList
    (Mandatory, No Default)

    The IP list you want to resolve to hostnames. This can be a single IP, comma seperated 
    list of IPs, or a list of IPs in a text file read in using the Get-Content cmdlet.

.PARAMETER  reportPath
    (Default = 'C:Temp')

    The path to the folder you want to save the report to. Defaults to the 
    'C:\Temp' folder.

.PARAMETER  reportName
    (Default = 'Resolve-IPToHostname_Report')

    The name you want the report to be called minus the extension.

.PARAMETER textReport
    (Default = False)

    This is a switch to create the output report as a TXT file instead of CSV, It will default
    to False, and will turn True when added to the end of the command (add -textReport)
